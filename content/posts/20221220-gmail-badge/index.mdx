If you're a Gmail user, but want a native app like experience, you might be using the _Create shortcut..._ feature available in Chrome and Chrome-based browsers, such as [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/download/). This feature opens a specific URL, such as `https://gmail.com/`, in a dedicated browser window and provides a separate icon on the dock (MacOS) or taskbar (Windows). But by default there's no badge counter for unread emails.

Fortunately, it is possible to add a badge by using the experimental [`Navigator.setAppBadge()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/setAppBadge). This experimental API is available only in Chrome as of this writing. Here I am going to combine the badge API with [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), a browser extension that uses the [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) APIs.

If you want to use the script, it is available from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jboxman/gmail-badge) in the `gmail-badge/dist/index.user.js` file.

Most of the work is performed by a [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver). The API is wrapped by `VM.observe` for convenience, and so we only need to provide a DOM element to monitor for mutations and a callback function:

```js title='Mutation callback function'
import * as VM from '@violentmonkey/dom';

VM.observe(document.head, () => {
  const $el = document.querySelector('title');
  // https://github.com/developit/Gmail-unread-count-badge/blob/main/src/content.js
  let m = String($el.innerText).match(/Inbox(?: \((\d+)\))? -/);
  if (m) navigator.setAppBadge(m[1] | 0 || null);
});
```

In the preceding code, we do the following:

- Observe the `<head>` DOM element for any changes.
- React to a change by querying the `<title>` DOM element, extracting the unread message count, and calling `navigator.setAppBadge` to set the badge number.

By using a MutationObserver, we ensure that whenever Google updates the unread message count in the page title, we can update our unread messages icon badge.

For reference, `VM.observe` wraps the `MutationObserver.observe` method in the [following way](https://github.com/violentmonkey/vm-dom):

```ts title='VM.observe() function'
export function observe(
  node: Node,
  callback: (
    mutations: MutationRecord[],
    observer: MutationObserver
  ) => boolean | void,
  options?: MutationObserverInit
): () => void {
  const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations, ob) => {
    const result = callback(mutations, ob);
    if (result) disconnect();
  });
  observer.observe(
    node,
    Object.assign(
      {
        childList: true,
        subtree: true,
      },
      options
    )
  );
  const disconnect = () => observer.disconnect();
  return disconnect;
}
```
